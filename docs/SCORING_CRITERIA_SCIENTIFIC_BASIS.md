# Scientific Basis for Policy Impact Scoring Criteria

## Overview
This document provides the **quantitative scientific basis** for assigning scores (1-5) to each dimension of policy assessment. All criteria are based on empirical research, international benchmarks, and statistical thresholds.

---

## 🎯 **1. SCOPE (Geographic/Demographic Reach)**

### Scientific Foundation
Based on **Public Policy Coverage Analysis** (Rothstein & Teorell, 2008) and **Universal Coverage Metrics** (OECD, 2019).

### Quantitative Scoring Criteria

| Score | Coverage Threshold | Scientific Justification | Examples |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| **5.0** | **≥80%** population coverage | **Universal Coverage Standard** (WHO, 2010): 80%+ = universal access threshold | HDB Housing (78.7% → rounds to 80%), NHS UK (99%) |
| **4.0-4.9** | **60-79%** population coverage | **High Coverage** (World Bank, 2018): Substantial but not universal | CPF mandatory (95% working pop = 60% total pop) |
| **3.0-3.9** | **40-59%** population coverage | **Moderate Coverage**: Policy reaches significant minority | SkillsFuture (40% uptake in first 5 years) |
| **2.0-2.9** | **20-39%** population coverage | **Limited Coverage**: Targeted policy with narrow reach | Housing grants for low-income (25% eligible) |
| **1.0-1.9** | **<20%** population coverage | **Minimal Coverage**: Pilot programs or highly selective | R&D tax incentives (5% of companies) |

### Data Sources for Verification
- **Singapore Department of Statistics**: Population coverage data
- **Ministry reports**: Program participation rates
- **OECD Social Policy Database**: International comparison benchmarks

## ⚡ **2. MAGNITUDE (Scale of Impact)**

### Scientific Foundation
Based on **Economic Impact Assessment** (Boardman et al., 2017) and **Social Return on Investment (SROI)** methodology (Nicholls et al., 2012).

### Quantitative Scoring Criteria

| Score | Impact Threshold | Scientific Justification | Measurement Methods |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **5.0** | **≥5% of GDP** impact OR **>50%** improvement in target metric | **Transformational Impact** (IMF, 2019): Policies affecting ≥5% GDP are macro-economically significant | HDB: 20% of GDP (housing sector) |
| **4.0-4.9** | **2-4.9% of GDP** OR **25-50%** improvement | **High Impact** (World Bank methodology): Major sectoral effects | CPF: 3.2% of GDP in contributions |
| **3.0-3.9** | **0.5-1.9% of GDP** OR **10-24%** improvement | **Moderate Impact**: Measurable economic/social effects | GST: 1.8% of GDP in revenue |
| **2.0-2.9** | **0.1-0.49% of GDP** OR **5-9%** improvement | **Limited Impact**: Small but measurable effects | SkillsFuture: 0.2% of GDP investment |
| **1.0-1.9** | **<0.1% of GDP** OR **<5%** improvement | **Minimal Impact**: Marginal effects | Pilot programs, small grants |

### Measurement Methodologies
- **Economic Impact**: GDP contribution, employment effects, productivity gains
- **Social Impact**: Health outcomes, education attainment, inequality reduction
- **Before-After Analysis**: Pre/post policy implementation comparisons
- **Control Group Studies**: Policy vs non-policy areas comparison

## 🏗️ **3. DURABILITY (Long-term Sustainability)**

### Scientific Foundation
Based on **Policy Sustainability Theory** (May & Jochim, 2013) and **Institutional Longevity Analysis** (Pierson, 2000).

### Quantitative Scoring Criteria

| Score | Durability Threshold | Scientific Justification | Indicators |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| **5.0** | **≥30 years** active OR designed for **multi-generational** impact | **Institutional Permanence** (Mahoney & Thelen, 2010): 30+ years = institutionalized | HDB Act (1960-present: 65 years) |
| **4.0-4.9** | **15-29 years** active OR **one generation** impact | **High Durability**: Cross-electoral cycles, embedded in institutions | CPF (1955-present: 70 years) |
| **3.0-3.9** | **5-14 years** active OR **medium-term** design | **Moderate Durability**: Survives government changes | GST (1994-present: 31 years) |
| **2.0-2.9** | **2-4 years** active OR **short-term** design | **Limited Durability**: Electoral cycle dependent | Budget policies, temporary measures |
| **1.0-1.9** | **<2 years** OR **pilot/temporary** status | **Minimal Durability**: Experimental or crisis response | COVID-19 support packages |

### Durability Indicators
- **Legal Framework**: Constitutional/statutory vs administrative
- **Institutional Embedding**: Independent agencies vs ministerial programs
- **Political Consensus**: Bipartisan support vs partisan policy
- **Financial Sustainability**: Self-funding vs budget-dependent

## 🔄 **4. ADAPTABILITY (Flexibility and Evolution)**

### Scientific Foundation
Based on **Adaptive Policy Management** (Walker et al., 2001) and **Policy Learning Theory** (Dunlop & Radaelli, 2013).

### Quantitative Scoring Criteria

| Score | Adaptability Threshold | Scientific Justification | Measurement |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **5.0** | **≥5 major adaptations** OR **annual review cycles** | **Highly Adaptive** (OECD, 2020): Continuous improvement systems | Digital Economy Framework (yearly updates) |
| **4.0-4.9** | **3-4 major adaptations** OR **biennial reviews** | **High Adaptability**: Regular systematic updates | CPF (multiple enhancements since 1955) |
| **3.0-3.9** | **2 major adaptations** OR **irregular reviews** | **Moderate Adaptability**: Responsive to major changes | GST rate changes (1994, 2003, 2007, 2023) |
| **2.0-2.9** | **1 major adaptation** OR **one-time reviews** | **Limited Adaptability**: Minimal responsiveness | Housing policies (occasional adjustments) |
| **1.0-1.9** | **No adaptations** OR **rigid implementation** | **Minimal Adaptability**: Static design | Fixed-term programs, legacy systems |

### Adaptability Metrics
- **Policy Amendments**: Number and frequency of legislative changes
- **Implementation Flexibility**: Administrative discretion levels
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Stakeholder consultation processes
- **Innovation Integration**: Technology and practice updates

## 🔬 **Example: HDB Housing Scope Score Calculation**

### Data Collection
- **Coverage Data**: 78.7% of Singapore residents live in HDB flats (DOS, 2023)
- **International Comparison**: vs OECD public housing rates (average 15%)
- **Universal Coverage Threshold**: WHO standard 80% for universal access

### Score Assignment Process
1. **Quantitative Assessment**: 78.7% falls in 60-79% range
2. **International Context**: Singapore ranks #1 globally in public housing coverage
3. **Universal Coverage Analysis**: Just below 80% threshold but approaching universal
4. **Final Score**: 4.8/5.0 (high-end of 4.0-4.9 range due to near-universal coverage + global leadership)

### Scientific Justification
- **Empirical Basis**: Verified government statistics
- **Comparative Context**: International benchmarking
- **Theoretical Framework**: Universal coverage principles
- **Transparency**: Clear scoring rationale with evidence

## 📈 **Quality Assurance Process**

### Annual Recalibration
1. **Data Updates**: Latest statistics and international rankings
2. **Threshold Review**: Adjust quantitative criteria based on global trends
3. **Methodology Validation**: Academic peer review of scoring methods
4. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Input from policy experts and practitioners

### Documentation Requirements
