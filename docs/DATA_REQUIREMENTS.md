2. **At least 2 assessment points** per policy
3. **Budget and beneficiary data**
4. **Key performance metrics**

### Phase 2: Enhanced Data (Should Have)
1. **Time-series performance data**
2. **External validation studies**
3. **Stakeholder feedback**
4. **International comparisons**

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Nice to Have)
1. **Social media sentiment analysis**
2. **Economic modeling data**
3. **Predictive indicators**
4. **Cross-policy correlation data**

## ðŸ“Š **Data Quality Requirements**

### Minimum Standards:
- **Completeness**: 80% of required fields filled
- **Accuracy**: Data verified from official sources
- **Recency**: Assessments within last 3 years
- **Consistency**: Standardized formats and scales

### Data Sources Priority:
1. **Primary**: Government official reports
2. **Secondary**: Academic peer-reviewed studies
3. **Tertiary**: Reputable media and think tanks
4. **Supporting**: Social media and surveys

## ðŸ”§ **Data Integration Process**

### Step 1: Data Collection Template
- Create standardized data collection forms
- Define data validation rules
- Set up automated quality checks

### Step 2: Historical Data Backfill
- Identify key policies from 1965-2025
- Prioritize high-impact policies first
- Use available historical assessments

### Step 3: Real-time Data Pipeline
- Connect to government data APIs
- Set up regular assessment schedules
- Monitor policy performance continuously
